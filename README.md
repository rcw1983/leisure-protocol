A speculative framework for non-coercive time

I value productivity only insofar as being productive grants me more time to be unproductive.
I rest when I need to rest. I try to be attentive to the signs. 
I cultivate my interests. I follow my curiosity. 
I affirm the right of others to do the same. 
I am worthy of my own interest.
